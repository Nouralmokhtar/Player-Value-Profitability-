## Business Question 1: Player Value & Profitability

Objective:
Identify the most valuable players based on betting behavior, deposits, and real profitability.

Approach:
I aggregated player-level betting, deposit, and withdrawal data to calculate GGR, Net Cash, and engagement metrics.

Key Insights:
- A small subset of players generates the majority of GGR
- High VIP level does not always equal high profitability
- Some players show risky patterns (high deposit, low play)

Business Recommendation:
- Revisit VIP segmentation logic
- Target high-GGR low-VIP players with tailored offers
- Monitor low-activity high-deposit players for churn risk
